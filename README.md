# Telecom-Churn-Model
Data Science project
The industry is at the epicenter of growth with the
advancements being made in mobile and internet services.
With the increasing number of competitors in the market,
it has become a challenge to meet the growing customer
expectations and provide delightful customer services.
Thus, the customers are switching telecom companies for
various reasons and as a result the business gets adversely
affected. This has been continuing for years, but for
managing the business and bringing up the customer
number and profit, it is necessary that they identify the
loyal customers. The telecom companies must either retain
the existing customers or draw new customers. But the
latter is difficult to achieve as there are less chances of that
happening. Henceforth, this leaves us with the major
option of retaining existing customers and in order to do
so, different marketing strategies needs to be considered
by the Telecom Company. The predictive models can
enable the telecom businesses to recognize the loyal
customers which will facilitate them to initiate the
retention campaigns to attract new and retain the existing
loyal customers.
